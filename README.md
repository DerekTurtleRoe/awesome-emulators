## ‚ùì FAQ

### Where can I download games?

My lawyers have told me to say that you should dump your own software for use in emulators. I don't support piracy and I won't engage in discussions of piracy here. This includes (but is not limited to) piracy of emulators, piracy of software for use in emulators, etc.

### Can you give me personal help with emulator setup, dumping games and software, or other things?

Even though I would love to help every person, sometimes life happens and I need time to myself for projects, things that provide me with money to survive, or other things. As long as you are patient with me, I will try to help you if I can via my Discord. I have a channel dedicated to technical support there. Please at least show effort and Google around and read documentation before asking for help, and please provide as much information as you can before trying to get help.

Please do not open issues for anything other than issues with this project itself. If you do, they will be locked and closed.
